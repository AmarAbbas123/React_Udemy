a library provides pre-written code modules (functions, classes) that developers can use to perform specific tasks, while a framework provides a structured environment or blueprint for building an applicationLibraries:Purpose:Libraries offer pre-written code for specific functions, like handling file I/O, networking, or data manipulation. Control Flow:Developers have complete control over when and how to call the library functions. Analogy:Think of a library as a collection of tools (e.g., hammers, screwdrivers) that you can use independently to build something. Examples:jQuery, NumPy, Django's ORM. Frameworks:Purpose:Frameworks provide a structured architecture and a predefined flow for building an application. Control Flow:Frameworks dictate the application flow, and developers plug their code into predefined parts of the framework's structure. Analogy:A framework is like a blueprint for building a house, where you follow a defined structure and plug in your own code into specified sections. Examples:React, Spring Framework, Node.js. __________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________A website primarily presents information in a static or semi-static format, focusing on delivering content to users. A web application, on the other hand, is designed for interactivity and allows users to perform specific tasks and interact with dataWebsites serve to inform, and web apps serve to helpWebsite:Purpose: To display information and provide a general online presence.Interactivity: Limited to basic navigation, clicking links, and possibly simple forms.Content: Typically static or updated infrequently.Examples: News websites, blogs, company websites, portfolios. Web Application:Purpose:To provide interactive tools and services, allowing users to perform tasks. Interactivity:High level of user interaction, including data input, manipulation, and processing. Content:Dynamic content that updates based on user actions, data changes, or real-time events. Examples:Online shopping platforms, social media sites, online banking, e-commerce, Gmail. _________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Client-side rendering (CSR) is a JavaScript rendering technique where the final HTML content and user interface (UI) components are generated on the client's browser using JavaScript.In the CSR approach:The server sends an initial HTML file with minimal contentThe client-side JavaScript code fetches data from the serverThe JavaScript code renders the complete UI on the browserJavaScript frameworks like React, Vue.js, Angular, Svelte, Backbone.js, and Ember.js are commonly used to implement client-side rendering.Server-side rendering (SSR) is a rendering approach where the rendering process occurs on the server.In this approach, the server generates the complete HTML page with the rendered UI and sends it to the client's browser. The browser then displays the fully rendered page without running any client-side JavaScript code.JavaScript meta-frameworks like Next.js, Nuxt.js, SvelteKit, Angular Universal, Remix, Astro, and Qwik are commonly used to implement server-side rendering._______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________JS ES6const data = [    {        id: 1,        title: "The Lord of the Rings",        publicationDate: "1954-07-29",        author: "J.

It provides a concise way to unpack values from data structures (array or object).e.g:function getBooks() {    return data;}function getBook(id) {    return data.find((d) => d.id === id);}const book = getBook(1);const { title, author, genres } = book;    //object destructuringconsole.log(title, author, genres);const [val1, val2, val3, val4] = genres;   // array destructuringconsole.log(val1, val2, val3, val4);+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Rest Operator:The rest operator collects multiple elements and condenses them into a single array.function getBooks() {    return data;}function getBook(id) {    return data.find((d) => d.id === id);}const book = getBook(1);const { title, author, genres } = book; const [val1, val2, ...all] = genres;   // array destructuringconsole.log(val1, val2, all);Spread Operator:The spread operator expands an iterable (like an array or object) into individual elements.const newGenres = [...genres, "new array element"]console.log(newGenres)+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++=Template literals :Template literals are strings wrapped in backticks (`), not quotes.const summary = `a book ${newGenres}`console.log(summary)let text = `He's often called "Johnny"`;+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++=ternary operator : The ternary operator in JavaScript is a shorthand way of writing an if-else statementcondition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalselet age = 20;let message = age >= 18 ? "You are an adult" : "You are a minor";+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++=Short-circuiting: Short-circuiting happens when JavaScript stops evaluating an expression as soon as it knows the result.It mainly applies to:|| (OR)&& (AND)e.g:OR (||) — Returns the first truthy valueconst userInput = "";const finalInput = userInput || "Default value";console.log(finalInput); // "Default value"AND (&&) — Returns the first falsy valueconsole.log('Hello' && 0);      // 0console.log(42 && 'World');   // "World"const isLoggedIn = true;isLoggedIn && console.log("Show dashboard"); // Output: "Show dashboard"+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++map()Purpose: Transforms each element of an array and returns a new array of the same length.const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];const doubled = numbers.map(num => num * 2);console.log(doubled); filter()Purpose: Filters elements based on a condition and returns a new array with only the elements that satisfy that condition.const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];const even = numbers.filter(num => num % 2 === 0);console.log(even); // [2, 4]reduce()Purpose: Reduces the array to a single value by accumulating results.const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];const sum = numbers.reduce((accumulator, current) => accumulator + current, 0);console.log(sum); // 10+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++optional chaining (?.) — a super handy feature in JavaScript that helps avoid those annoying errors like "Cannot read property 'x' of undefined"const user = {  greet: () => "Hello!"};console.log(user.greet?.()); // "Hello!"console.log(user.farewell?.()); // undefined (no error)++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Callback?A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function, which is then executed later, usually after some kind of event or operation.function greet(name, callback) {  console.log("Hello, " + name);  callback();}function sayBye() {  console.log("Goodbye!");}greet("Ali", sayBye);Hello, AliGoodbye!+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Promises in JavaScript are objects representing the eventual result of an asynchronous operation. They provide a structured way to handle asynchronous code, improving readability and manageability compared to traditional callback functions. A promise can be in one of three states:Pending: The initial state, where the asynchronous operation is still in progress.Fulfilled (Resolved): The operation completed successfully, and a result value is available.Rejected: The operation failed, and an error or reason for failure is available.A promise is created using the Promise constructor, which takes a function with two arguments: resolve and reject. Inside this function, you perform the asynchronous operation. If the operation is successful, you call resolve with the result. If it fails, you call reject with an error or reason.let myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {  // Perform asynchronous operation (e.g., fetching data from an API)  setTimeout(() => {    const success = true; // Simulate success or failure    if (success) {      resolve("Operation successful!");    } else {      reject("Operation failed!");    }  }, 1000);});To handle the result or error of a promise, you use the then and catch methods respectively. The then method is called when the promise is fulfilled, and the catch method is called when the promise is rejected.myPromise.then(result => {  console.log("Result:", result); // Output: "Result: Operation successful!"}).catch(error => {  console.error("Error:", error);});++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++async/awaitasync:This keyword is used to declare a function as asynchronous. When you mark a function with async, it automatically returns a Promise. await:This keyword can only be used inside an async function. It pauses the execution of the function until a Promise is resolved, and then returns the resolved value. async function getData() {  try {    const response = await fetch('https://example.com/api/data');    const data = await response.json();    console.log(data);  } catch (error) {    console.error('Error:', error);  }}getData();In this example, the getData() function is declared as async. Inside the function, await fetch() pauses the execution until the fetch call returns aresponse. Then, await response.json() pauses the function until the response is parsed as JSON, and the resulting data is stored in the data variable. ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________React : React is a component based, state-friven javascript library for building user interfaces.Components: Components are the building blocks of React applications, serving as independent and reusable pieces of UI. They allow developers to divide complex interfaces into smaller, manageable parts, promoting modularity and code reuse. There are two main types of components in React:Functional Components: These are JavaScript functions that accept props as arguments and return JSX, describing what should be rendered on the screen. They are simpler and more concise, and are generally preferred for most use cases, especially with the advent of React Hooks, which allow them to manage state and lifecycle events.Class Components: These are ES6 classes that extend React.Component and implement a render() method to return JSX. They can also manage state and lifecycle events using class methods. While still supported, class components are less common in modern React development, with functional components and Hooks being the more prevalent approach.Code_
